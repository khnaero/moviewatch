# Movie Watch

This is a movie reviews Ruby on Rails app. Users are able to submit new movies and add reviews to each one. A basic rating system is implemented via a star rating plugin called jQuery Raty. Users can also search for movies using a search bar powered by the Searchkick gem. In order for Searchkick to work, I
needed to install Oracle JDK 8, which is required by the Elasticsearch installation.
